      				<p>
      					I'm currently a student at Western University's Ivey Business School, working towards an 
      					Honours BA in business administration (HBA). In my first two years at Western, I studied
      					software engineering, and in doing so discovered my love for technology! I've since been
      					greatly invested in learning as much as I can about technnology, through both engineering
      					and coroprate lenses.
      				</p>
      				
      				<p>
      					In addition to my studies with Western, I am also constantly learning on my own. I spent my
      					summer reading all the textbooks I could about web development, and in doing so have gained
      					a plethora of web knowhow. I am currently reading books on data science and machine learning
      					- a set of topics that excite me immensely - as well as a bit on cryptography. 
      				</p>
      				
      				<p>
      					Outside of this, I'm an avid songwriter/general music nerd, an editor for western's technology 
      					review, a dad to two awesome dogs,and the owner of a collection of converse high-top shoes.

    			</div>
      			<div class="panel-body">
      				<p>
      					I am currently on the hunt for a technical summer internship in the field of software 
      					engineering or data science. I'm looking for an opportunity to tackle interesting 
      					problems, and gain valuable work experience that will kickstart my professional 
      					career in technology!
      				</p>
      				
      				<p>
      					In the longer term, I'm hoping to seed my own startup within the next decade, contingent on
      					gaining sufficient industry experience. I've always enjoyed making things - that's why I got
      					into software engeineering - starting a business may well be my most rewarding project yet!
